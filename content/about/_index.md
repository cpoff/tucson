This is a site about football/soccer in southern Arizona. Tucson specifically. So it goes without saying that there will be a heavy focus on [Tucson FC](https://www.fctucson.com/).

I have ESPN+ - which airs all USL games starting in 2019 - so I'll try to post timely post-game reports. I'll also try to attend as many home games (at Kino Sports Complex) as possible.
